## **DSA project SEM232**
Implement simple classification algorithm **k-nearest neighbors** **(kNN)** to process and classify data from the given **MNIST** data set.

- The **MNIST** dataset contains a set of images captured from handwritten samples of digits from 0 to 9, with each image having a size of **28x28** pixels.

- The **kNN** algorithm predicts the label for a new data point based on the **labels** of its neighbors. kNN relies on the assumption that similar data points will be close to each other in the coordinate space. Based on the labels of the neighbors, we can predict the label for a new data point.
